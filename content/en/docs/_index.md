**Petra Cipher library** is an encryption library that supports **C++** and **Java** languages. This library provides authenticated encryption algorithms to securely encrypt and decrypt data using the **Petra Cipher key server**. Encryption keys are safely acquired from the Petra Cipher key server.

Using the Petra Cipher library, it is possible to perform the following tasks:

* **Data encryption and decryption** - The Petra Cipher library allows data to be encrypted and decrypted securely. This library generates safe encryption keys to encrypt and decrypt data.

* **Petra Cipher key server usage** - The Petra Cipher library uses the Petra Cipher key server to protect data. The Petra Cipher key server generates and manages secure keys.

* **Multi-platform support** - The Petra Cipher library supports C++ and Java languages, enabling it to be used on multiple platforms.

The Petra Cipher library is designed for secure encryption and data protection. Developers using the library can acquire secure keys from the Petra Cipher key server to encrypt and decrypt data safely.
